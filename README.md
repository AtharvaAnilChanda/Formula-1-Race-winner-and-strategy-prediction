## Introduction
This project is done by our above mentioned team as a part of our machine intelligence mini project of Semester 5. In this project, we have striven to create an effective prediction model to find the next race winner in the popular motor sport formula 1 and also predict the life span of the car tyres in order to come up with an effective race strategy. This project has been done completely using python !!

Since we wanted this to be decently accurate , we have considered the data set of the 2022 season of which we have collected and analysed data of 4 races which we found as game changers in order to predict the next couple of races . All the data used in this project is available publically and was extracted by us using the FastF1 api in python . 


## Getting Started
1. Download all the datasets and notebooks provided.
2. Install the library 'FastF1' incase you require to download your own datasets.
